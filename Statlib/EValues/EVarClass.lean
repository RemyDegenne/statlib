# Classes of e-variables

The existence proof of the numeraire (`Statlib.EValues.NumeraireExistence`) uses only a few
properties of the class `{X | IsEVar X S}` of e-variables for a set of measures `S`: it consists of
measurable functions, contains `1`, is convex and is closed under `liminf` of sequences. This file
isolates those properties in the predicate `IsEVarClass`, so that the results also apply to classes
which are not of the form `{X | IsEVar X S}`, for example classes obtained by adding a constraint
such as adaptedness.

## Main definitions

* `IsEVarClass 𝓔`: `𝓔` is a set of measurable functions containing `1`, convex and closed under
  `liminf` of sequences.
* `midSeq X`: the iterated midpoints of a sequence `X`, a convex combination of `X 0, …, X n` with
  positive weights.

## Main statements

* `isEVarClass_isEVar`: the e-variables for a set of finite measures form an `IsEVarClass`. The
  results proved for a class thus apply to e-variables.
* `IsEVarClass.inter`: the intersection of a class with a convex, `liminf`-closed set containing `1`
  is again a class.
* `IsEVarClass.exists_forall_ae_eq_top`: for an s-finite measure `P`, some element of the class is
  infinite wherever any other element is, up to a `P`-null set.

/-! ### The maximal set of infinities

The existence proof of the numeraire needs one element of the class to be infinite wherever any
other element is. This follows from `IsEVarClass` alone: we maximize the measure of the set of
infinities along a sequence and take iterated midpoints, which are infinite as soon as one of their
terms is. -/

/-- Iterated midpoints of a sequence: a convex combination of `X 0, …, X n` in which every term
has a positive weight, so it takes the value `∞` as soon as one of them does. -/
